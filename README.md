# Layout with SASS

## Installation 

You need to install [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). If you wanna install globally, in my case I'm using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), you need to put in the command line

```bash
npm install -g SASS
```

## Usage  

If you wanna make changes in the document, put in the command line 

```bash
sass --watch assets/sass/main.scss assets/css/main.css
```

This command will make SASS detect changes in your document and compile them automatically. In my case that is the route declared in this example, you should change it to the route that you use. 
So when you save a change, it will automatically compile into the .css file
